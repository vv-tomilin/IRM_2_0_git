	CsvDelete

	Prerequisites:

		You need a CSV file with only one header field
		x) <NodeName>			[MANDATORY]		Node name, if the node is a folder or objects, all children nodes will automatically get deleted

	How the script works:

		1) Start the script by right clicking on your "OBJECTS" folder and choosing Node actions - ATVISE -> CsvDelete
		2) Choose the CSV input file in the appearing dialog
		3) The script reads the given CSV file line by line - it will delete folders/variables/objects
		4) WAIT UNTIL THE DIALOG BOX "script finished succesfully" appears - atvise builder and project console can not be used while the import is running
		5) Refresh your "OBJECTS" tree by right clicking it once
		6) The script will print out a short summary of succesfully deleted nodes in the server log
